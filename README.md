# uv-vscode

A VS Code extension that provides enhanced integration with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), the fast Python package installer and resolver. This extension makes it easier to manage Python dependencies and work with inline script metadata (PEP 723) directly in VS Code.

## Highlights

### Manage your dependencies directly from the pyproject.toml file or from a [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) compatible script.

### Enter a [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) compatible script environment to get autocompletion and resolve imports correctly.
